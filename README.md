# imessage-data
Track your computer's iMessages. Used as my first html/javascript project

Notes:
- For MacOS systems only 
- Depending on your version of MacOS, you may need to modify archivePath in iMessageTools.py
- This project was imported from a private repo. I did it wrong while learning. I can provide commit histories if needed
